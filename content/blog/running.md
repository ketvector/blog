1. Just get to the next milestone, we’ll take it from there.

2. Breaths are hard right now, push with your body.

3. The body is tired right now, focus on the breathing.

4. Slow down, breathe deep, we’ll pick up pace later.

5. Don’t get injured.

6. Don’t think, run on instinct for a while. Be an animal.

7. Let’s get that PR today (personal record).

8. I’m going to lie down on that grass later.

9. I’ve done this 3 days in a row now, let me keep it light today.

10. I should lift more.
