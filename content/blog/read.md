A roughly reverse chronological (latest first) list of books I have read and would like to share about. 

- [Jung : A very short intoduction ,by Anthony Stevens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297554.Jung)

My biggest takeaway from this book was the idea of the "shadow", which explains a lot about human behavior and helps me think about my own behavior.

- [More than Allegory: On religious myth, truth & belief, by Bernardo Kastrup](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/28139522-more-than-allegory)

Bernardo's interpretations of religious myths, inspired in part by the works Carl Jung & Joseph Campbell, resonated with me, gave me a lot of food for thought and a way to think positively about religion.

- [Range: Why generalists triumph in a specialised world, by David Epstein](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range)

Epstein is a journalist and I liked this book primarily for the current & historical stories it used to make it's point. It felt like reading interesting newspaper articles.

- [The idea of the world, by Bernardo Kastrup ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40828142-the-idea-of-the-world)

This book is a collection of phillosophy papers. Bernardo's phillosophy of idealism is very similar to that of advaita vedanta from the upanishads. Bernardo has a PhD in both computer science and phillosophy, and the ideas were presented in a modern context.

- [The psychology of Money, by Morgan Housel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money)

Useful advice. The thing I remember the most is that "time is money", and "no amount of earning can offset bad financial habbits". Full of anecdotes, including some from the author's personal life. Author sounds like the kind of guy I would love to be friends with.

- [12 rules for life, by Jordan Peterson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30257963-12-rules-for-life)

- [Influence: The psycology of persuasion, by Robert Cialdini](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence)

Insightful and a must read "self defence manual" in the age of widespread advertising, marketing and "nudging" techniques employed by corporations, social media companies, political parties and cults.

- [No rules rules: Netflix and the culture of reinvention, by Reed Hastings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49099937-no-rules-rules)

- [That will never work: The birth of Netflix and the amazing life of an idea, by Marc Randolph](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44428950-that-will-never-work)

- [Atomic Habbits, by James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40244063-atomic-habits)

- [Man's search for meaning, by Victor Frankl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning)

- [Tuesdays with Morrie, by Mitch Albom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6900.Tuesdays_with_Morrie)

- [Zero to One, by Peter Thiel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one)
