I took a career break in April 2023 to focus on some personal interests, spend time with family, travel, and decide what next to do with my life. I am briefly documenting how I spent some of my time during that period.

To begin, I did a 10 day Vippasana course in Jaipur. Vippasana is a medidation technique developed more than 2000 years ago by the budhists.

Then, I ended up spending the first 3 months of this period studying physics, something which I had wanted to do for a while. 
I started with Quantum Mechanics. I used Leonard Suskinds book and the Nielsen & Chuang reference for my studies. I wrote an introductory article as a reference for new learners, which you can find here: [a tutorial introduction to quantum mechanics](https://ketvector.github.io/blog/101.pdf). I then spent some time studying CLassical Mechanics (the Hamiltionian/Lagrangian approach), and Special Relativity - both from Leonard Susskind's books.

After this I was upto several things including:

- I  wanted to learn haskell so I spent some time doing that. And jumped a bit into Category Theory during this same period. You can find some of [my haskell code here](https://github.com/ketvector/haskell-practice)

- I read about Phillioshophy and Psychology and was influenced/intrigued/confounded/ by the works of Carl Jung, Bernardo Kastrup, Thomas Nagel, Nick Bostrom, Kant, Spinoza and others. Perhaps I will write more about this in some time.

- I self taught myself the basics of generative AI - transformers, diffusion models, bayesian reasoning etc. Spent some time writing ML code as well. [Some Code](https://github.com/ketvector/ml-practice)

- Travelled a bit around India. I visited the Andaman Islands, Varanasi, Bhabhua (Bihar), Lucknow, Delhi, Agra, Chikmagalur, Satara & Harda during this period.

- Got into bodybuilding and running.
